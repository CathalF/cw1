# GoalLine API

GoalLine API is a RESTful football data service exposing competitions, seasons, teams, players, matches, and user match notes. The project uses Flask with MongoDB and follows the coursework specification for COM661.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values for your environment.
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   flask --app goalline_api.app:create_app run --debug
   ```

## Dataset

The API is intended to work with data derived from the [OpenFootball](https://github.com/openfootball) datasets. Sample, coursework-friendly JSON exports are included under `data/` to let you experiment immediately. Use `scripts/load_openfootball.py` to transform and import the bundled (or your own) datasets into MongoDB collections:

```bash
python -m goalline_api.scripts.load_openfootball
```

The script inserts the demo Premier League competition, season, teams, players, and a representative match so the API endpoints return meaningful data out of the box. Replace the JSON files with larger OpenFootball exports when you are ready for the full dataset.

## Testing

A Postman collection and environment file are provided under `tests/` to cover standard and error scenarios. Use Newman to run the automated test suite:

```bash
newman run tests/postman_collection.json -e tests/newman_env.json
```
